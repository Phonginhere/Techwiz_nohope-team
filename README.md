# Introduction
Modern fast-paced lifestyles have led to deteriorating health conditions. People are now
contracting ailments far earlier and spending more on hospitals and institutionalized
healthcare. Heart diseases, back aches, inflamed joints, diabetes, and so on are becoming
too common and are being seen even in younger people.

To counter this, one should adopt a fitter and healthier lifestyle, that will have a good
balance of nutrition, exercise, activity, and rest.

The proposed Website will be titled Fit4Life and should help individuals with fitness
programs and diet plans.
